# ArmorStandTools translations
This repository contains the translated files for the [ArmorStandTools][plugin] plugin. Both the config.yml and language.yml got translated.

## How to use
You can use the file in two ways:

### Download
You can download the file.  
To do that, click the "Code" icon and select "Download ZIP". You can then extract the files from the zip file using 7Zip or WinRAR.

Note that you need to rename the files to either `config.yml` or `language.yml` to make it work with ArmorStandTools.  
It is also important that you use the right version depending on your MC Version. The files have their supported MC Versions in the name.

### Replace text
You can just select the file's content and replace the content of the `config.yml` and `language.yml`.  
Keep in mind that this may break your setup when doing so.
